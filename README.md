This note should also be in the submission comment, but I could not find a working method to commit the zip file with the StarterContent folder which is over 600 mb, so I deleted it and then zipped. Please add this folder back to Source when unzipping, and you should be able to get this folder by opening up the unreal engine 4.24.3 fps blueprint and then copying that folder.
