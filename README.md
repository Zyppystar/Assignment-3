# Assignment-3
This note should also be in the submission comment, but I could not find a working method to commit the source zip file with the StarterContent folder which is over 600 mb, so I deleted it and then zipped. Please add this folder back to Source when unzipping, and you should be able to get this folder by opening up the unreal engine 4.24.3 fps blueprint and then copying that folder.
I spent a couple hours fiddling with git LFS trying to commit the build zip. Even when maximally compressed, the total file size was around 400 mb. I ended up separating the Engine file from WindowsNoEditor and zipping that, but the primary part of build would not submit through LFS for some reason. I fully compressed FPSBlueprint-WindowsNoEditor.pak but the file was still around 300 mb, and without being able to use git LFS, I couldn't commit the file since it's over 100 mb.
